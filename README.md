# Visualize RAG retrieval

![RAG Visualization Demo](demo.gif)

### This notebook was created to visualize what happens in RAG-retrieval. It is for showing how queries are matched to chunks. It can also reveal that the retrieval is not 100% accurate if you simply send the user query to the database. Instead, some pre-processing may be needed to find the correct chunks when using it with e.g. a chatbot.
